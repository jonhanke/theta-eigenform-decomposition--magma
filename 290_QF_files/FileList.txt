e4r.m -- This is a list of lists representing the Gram matrices of the 6560 "Basic Escalator" 
      quadratic forms in four variables arising in the proof of the 290-Theorem.  These are 
      given the global name 'Basic_Quaternaries'.

104_auxiliary_quaternaries.m -- This is a list of lists representing the Gram matrices of the 
      104 "Auxiliary Escalator" quadratic forms in four variables arising in the proof of the 
      290-Theorem.  These are given the global name 'Auxiliary_Quaternaries'.


290-cusp-all.m -- Datafile provided by William Stein that computes the cuspidal constants for 
      the forms arising in the 290-Theorem.  (Read his old e-mail to see what everything means.)

MND.txt -- A list of the maximal newform (field of definition) degrees for all cuspidal spaces 
      of the level and character of the theta series of the [???WHICH ONES???] escalator forms.
