This code allows one to write the theta series of a positive definite quadratic form in four variables as a sum of its Eisenstein series and a linear combination of normalized Hecke eigenforms (which are cusp forms normalized so the first Fourier coefficient is 1).  This can be applied to obtain explicit bounds for representing integers by positive definite quadratic forms in n>=4 variables (as described in the 2004 Duke Math. Journal paper of Hanke "Local Densities and Explicit Bounds for Representability by a Quadratic Form").  This can also be repeatedly applied to prove explicit finiteness theorems for quadratic forms (e.g. the 290-Theorem).
